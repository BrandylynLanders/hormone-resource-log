# Zepbound (Tirzepatide) and Thyroid Considerations

## Overview
Zepbound (tirzepatide) is a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist used for weight management and type 2 diabetes. Like other GLP-1 drugs (e.g., Ozempic, Wegovy), it carries a black box warning regarding a specific type of thyroid cancer. This file summarizes the key considerations for individuals managing thyroid health, especially while on hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FDA Black Box Warning

> "Zepbound may cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in rodents."

- Based on animal studies, **not confirmed in humans**
- Applies to all GLP-1 receptor agonists
- **Contraindicated if you have:**
  - A personal or family history of **medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)**
  - **MEN2** (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2)
  - A known thyroid nodule or suspicious findings

## üß† Does Zepbound Affect Thyroid Function?

| Area | Known Effect |
|------|--------------|
| TSH, Free T3, Free T4 | No direct suppression or stimulation observed |
| Reverse T3 | May increase slightly due to stress, metabolism slowdown |
| Thyroid hormone absorption | Not affected |
| Nutrient depletion (indirect) | Appetite suppression may reduce intake of key thyroid nutrients (zinc, selenium, iodine, protein) |

## üîç What to Monitor While on Zepbound with Thyroid Support

- **Watch for symptoms** of low thyroid: cold hands/feet, fatigue, constipation, mood shifts
- Track **Free T3 and Reverse T3** if energy/motivation drops
- Consider **thyroid ultrasound** if any nodules or swelling present
- Continue optimizing **protein and micronutrient intake** to support thyroid conversion

## ‚úÖ Summary for Thyroid Patients

- Zepbound does not directly lower thyroid hormone levels but **may unmask low thyroid symptoms** in some users, especially during rapid weight loss or with suppressed nutrient intake.
- The black box warning is **specific to medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)** and **does not apply to common hypothyroidism**.
- Always discuss any thyroid history or medication use with your prescribing provider.
