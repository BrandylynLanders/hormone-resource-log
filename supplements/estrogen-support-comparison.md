This table outlines various supplements that support estrogen metabolism, including their function, ideal use cases, and cautions.

| Supplement                                   | What It Does                                                                                               | When It's Helpful                                                                     | When to Be Cautious                                                           | Dosage Range                                 |

| DIM (Diindolylmethane)                       | Supports Phase I liver detox; shifts estrogen to safer 2-OH form                                           | Estrogen dominance symptoms, poor clearance, bloating on HRT                          | May lower available estrogen if dose is too high or you’re estrogen-deficient | 25–100 mg 1–2x/day (start low)               |
| Calcium-D-Glucarate                          | Supports Phase II detox (glucuronidation); helps remove estrogen from the body                             | When gut issues interfere with estrogen elimination; supports healthy bowel movements | Very safe; rare side effects                                                  | 200–500 mg 1–2x/day                          |
| Methylated B Vitamins (B6, B12, Folate)      | Supports methylation, a Phase II detox pathway; needed for estrogen breakdown and neurotransmitter balance | Brain fog, mood swings, poor detox markers, MTHFR mutation                            | Avoid synthetic forms (use methylated or “active” versions)                   | Often in a B-complex or multi                |
| Magnesium (Glycinate or Citrate)             | Supports estrogen receptor sensitivity, nervous system, and elimination                                    | Sleep issues, anxiety, muscle tightness, constipation                                 | Too much citrate can cause loose stools                                       | 200–400 mg/day (glycinate is gentler)        |

| Probiotics / Gut Support                     | Supports the estrobolome (gut bacteria that regulate estrogen recycling)                                   | Bloating, history of antibiotics, irregular bowel movements                           | Some people react to specific strains                                         | 5–20 billion CFU, multi-strain is best       |
| Liver Support (Milk Thistle, NAC, dandelion) | Encourages liver enzyme activity for detox                                                                 | Heavy periods, acne, headaches, or sluggish liver function                            | Can be overkill with DIM unless under supervision                             | Follow label—start low if combining with DIM |
