# Hormone Research Log

## About This Project
This is a living knowledge base designed for women—especially those in perimenopause, menopause, or on hormone replacement therapy—who want clear, easy-to-digest information about hormones without needing a medical degree or hours of PubMed reading.

It includes:
- Simplified summaries of hormone-related studies
- A supplement comparison guide
- Charts and visuals explaining hormone pathways
- A growing dictionary of terms (e.g., E1, E2, E3, DIM, HRT methods)
- My personal notes and interpretations where helpful

## Who This Is For
Women like me—curious, health-conscious, often overwhelmed by conflicting info—and anyone seeking a central place to understand estrogen, progesterone, and related systems in plain English.

## Topics Covered
- The Basics
- Hormone Delivery Methods (patches, injections, creams, etc.)
- Estrogen Metabolism & Detox Pathways
- Progesterone, Cortisol, and the “Hormone Steal”
- Supplements like DIM, Magnesium, Calcium-D-Glucarate
- Nutrition and Exercise Considerations
- Hormone-Health Glossary (coming soon)

## Why GitHub?
Version control. Easy sharing. And because whynot. :)

This is currently a personal repo, but if you're a fellow researcher, nurse, practitioner, or hormone-explorer who wants to contribute or collaborate—let’s talk.
