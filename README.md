# Hormone Research Log

## About This Project
This is a living knowledge base designed for women—especially those in perimenopause, menopause, or on hormone replacement therapy—who want clear, easy-to-digest information about hormones without needing a medical degree or hours of PubMed reading.

It includes:
/articles-reviewed/         → Research article summaries, study links, PubMed notes  
/core-concepts/             → Foundational hormone education (receptors, metabolism, delivery methods)  
/hormone-impacts/           → How diet, exercise, stress, alcohol, drugs affect hormones  
/hrt/                       → Hormone replacement therapy specifics (protocols, comparisons, side effects)  
/data-definitions/          → Your hormone “data dictionary” – clear definitions of terms and metrics  

## Who This Is For
Women like me—curious, health-conscious, often overwhelmed by conflicting info—and anyone seeking a central place to understand estrogen, progesterone, and related systems in plain English.

## Topics Covered
