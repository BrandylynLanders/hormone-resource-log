# Estrogen Receptors & Hormone Binding Summary

## Estrogen Receptor Types

| Receptor | Primary Locations | Binds Best With | Key Functions |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **ERα** (Estrogen Receptor Alpha) | Breast, uterus, liver, hypothalamus | **E2 (estradiol)**, some E1 | Stimulates cell growth, metabolism, reproductive signaling, HPA regulation |
| **ERβ** (Estrogen Receptor Beta) | Ovaries, brain, colon, bone, immune cells | **E2 and E3 (estriol)** | Anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, regulates ERα activity |
| **GPER** (G-protein Coupled Estrogen Receptor) | Brain, cardiovascular system, endocrine tissues | **E2** | Rapid (non-genomic) signaling—vasodilation, neurotransmission |

## Estrogen Types and Receptor Affinities

| Estrogen | Full Name | Relative Strength | Primary Receptor Affinity |
|----------|------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **E1** | Estrone | Weak | Mild ERα activity |
| **E2** | Estradiol | **Strongest** | Strong affinity for both ERα and ERβ |
| **E3** | Estriol | Weak to moderate | **Prefers ERβ** (more calming, anti-proliferative) |

## Summary Notes

- **E2 (estradiol)** is the dominant and most potent estrogen; used most frequently in HRT and binds both ERα and ERβ.
- **E3 (estriol)** binds preferentially to ERβ, making it useful for **vaginal health**, **neuroprotection**, and calming overstimulation of tissues.
- **ERα** is linked to **growth signals**, especially in breast and uterine tissue.
- **ERβ** helps **modulate** ERα, acting like a biological “brake” on estrogen-driven processes.
- **GPER** responds to E2 and supports quick, short-term responses in **blood vessels** and the **nervous system**.
