# Thyroid and Estrogen Interaction Notes

## Overview
This document outlines how thyroid functionâ€”specifically T3 replacementâ€”interacts with estrogen levels, especially during hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It reflects personal experience and physiological patterns observed during estrogen fluctuations.

## Key Concepts

### ðŸ”„ Estrogen and Thyroid Hormone Binding
- Estrogen increases **thyroid-binding globulin (TBG)**, which binds more T3 and T4.
- This **lowers free (active) thyroid hormone** levels.
- Higher estrogen may reduce the *effectiveness* of a given T3 dose.

### ðŸ“‰ Low Estrogen = Increased T3 Sensitivity
- With less TBG (from lower estrogen), **more T3 remains unbound** and active.
- This may lead to **stronger-than-expected effects** of T3, especially later in the day.
- Symptoms may include **insomnia, overstimulation, anxiety**, or heart palpitations.

---

## Personal Observations

- Previously took **T3 twice daily**
- During a period of **low estrogen**, had to reduce to **morning-only dose**
  - Nighttime T3 caused insomnia and feeling wired
- As estrogen stabilizes on HRT, **T3 needs may change again**

---

## Notes for Tracking
- Monitor **sleep quality, energy, and mood**
- Take note of **body temperature** (especially upon waking)
- Reassess T3 dosing if:
  - Fatigue returns mid-day
  - Sleep improves but energy remains low
  - Lab markers change (Free T3, Reverse T3)

## Related Labs to Watch
- Free T3, Free T4, Reverse T3, TSH
- SHBG (reflects estrogen impact on liver)
- Ferritin, Selenium, Zinc, B12
